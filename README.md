Prooph With ProtoBuf
===============================

Prooph is a library to deal with CQRS and Event Sourcing with PHP ([more here](http://getprooph.org/)), and will be used with Protobuffers ([more here](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/)) to allow a simple cross service validation message exchaging.
