Prooph With Multilanguage Stack
===============================

Prooph is a library to deal with CQRS and Event Sourcing with PHP ([more here](http://getprooph.org/)), but there was no example about how to use in a multilanguage stack, or even between PHP systems that may not have Prooph because of some limitation.
